# NaturalizeNet
Remove beauty effects and smoothing filters applied on human faces. The first model is trained on a conditonal GAN (cGAN). The network removes beauty effects but is poor at restoring details. The dataset is created with  the flickr face dataset (https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset). For each portrait, we first apply a random number of times of face smoothing, then we add a makeup using a beautyGAN (cycleGAN model for adding beauty effects). Thanks https://github.com/Honlan/BeautyGAN and https://github.com/5starkarma/face-smoothing for the models. The training notebook is based on tensorflow's  pix2pix tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix.
